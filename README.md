# Graduate-Program
Looking at the rate of unemployed graduate, we have taken an innitiative as Computer engineering student to Design an Minimum Viable Product for 
a System that aims to reduce the rate of unemployement for graduate. We noticed the gap which makes it hard for graduates to find employment 
Most companies are moving to a digital worldphysical interactions are becoming obsulete so we designed a system that will connect companies with graduate 

How is Our System different 
- It allow it users to customerze their search 
- It allows clients to engage with companies their prefer 
- It is designed to the users satisfaction 
- It connects local and national Graduates and Employers 
- Chat ability 

The systgem is just an MVP due to the timeframe for the project to be completed 
The project focused more into creating a real life project while observing programmimng concepts such as
- Inheritance
- Polymophysim 
- Encapsulation 

The project was then futher brocken down to Three subsections which allowed us to then intergrate our system for a final 
review. A number of clussess were created to make sure that Object Oriented Programming concepts are met
